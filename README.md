### Dependency Management Strategy

**Centralized Configuration**
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Single source of truth for all dependencies
- **Service-specific requirements**: Auto-generated from central configuration
- **Version consistency**: Prevents conflicts across microservices

```bash
# Update dependencies (modify pyproject.toml, then regenerate)
python scripts/generate-requirements.py
docker-compose build

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install specific service dependencies
pip install -r services/ai-engine-service/requirements.txt
```

### Code Quality Standards
