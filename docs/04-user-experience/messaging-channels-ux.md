Good morning, Alex! ☀️

How are you feeling about today's goals?

Yesterday you mentioned wanting to drink more water. How did that go?

[User Response]
That's awesome! 💧 You're building a great habit.

Today's focus: Let's add a 10-minute walk after lunch. 

Does that feel doable with your schedule?

[Afternoon Follow-up - 2:00 PM]
Hey Alex! 👋

Just checking in - did you get that post-lunch walk in?

No pressure if not! Sometimes we need to adjust our plans. How's your day going?

```

#### Problem-Solving Support
```
[Struggling User Message]
"I missed my workout again today. I feel like I'm failing at this."

[AI Response]
I hear you, Alex. 💙 Missing one workout doesn't erase all your progress.

Let's problem-solve this together:

What got in the way today?
• Time constraints
• Low energy
• Lost motivation  
• Something else

Once I understand the challenge, I can help you find a solution that works better for your life.

Remember: Progress isn't perfection. It's about getting back on track. ✨

[Follow-up based on response]
Time constraints - I get it! Life gets busy.

What if we tried:
🕐 5-minute movement breaks instead of 30-min workouts
🏠 Home workouts (no commute time)
🌅 Morning routine before the day gets crazy
📱 Workout reminders on your phone

Which of these feels most realistic for your schedule?
